    "The Radiant MLHub API gives access to open Earth imagery training data for machine learning applications. You can learn more about the repository at the [Radiant MLHub site](https://mlhub.earth) and about the organization behind it at the [Radiant Earth Foundation site](https://radiant.earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook, which you may copy and adapt for any use, shows basic examples of how to use the API. Full documentation for the API is available at [docs.mlhub.earth](docs.mlhub.earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show you how to set up your authorization, see the list of available collections and datasets, and retrieve the items (the data contained within them) from those collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each item in our collection is explained in json format compliant with [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) [label extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/label) definition."

If you have not used Radiant MLHub before, you will need to sign up and create a new account. Otherwise, sign in. In the **API Keys** tab, you'll be able to create API key(s), which you will need. *Do not share* your API key with others: your usage may be limited and sharing your API key is a security risk.\n",
